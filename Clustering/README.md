**Clustering Algorithms Implementation**

Clustering is a technique in machine learning and data analysis used to group a set of data points into clusters based on their similarities or patterns. The goal of clustering is to ensure that:

Data points in the same cluster are more similar to each other.
Data points in different clusters are as dissimilar as possible.

Overview

This repository contains implementations of various clustering algorithms. Each clustering method is presented in a separate Colab notebook, complete with code, documentation, and explanatory videos. The tasks range from implementing clustering algorithms from scratch to using state-of-the-art tools for advanced techniques.

Objectives

- Implement clustering algorithms to solve real-world problems.
- Explore and apply quality measures for clustering performance.
- Develop hands-on experience using libraries such as PyCaret, PyOD, and LLM embeddings.
- Document and present findings effectively.

Contents

This repository is divided into multiple Colab notebooks, each focusing on a specific clustering algorithm or application:

1. K-Means Clustering (From Scratch) -

K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used to group data points into a predefined number of clusters (K). It works by iteratively assigning each data point to one of ùêæ. K clusters based on its similarity to the cluster's centroid (the central point of a cluster). The algorithm aims to minimize the total variance within clusters, resulting in clusters where points are as similar as possible to the centroid.

2. Hierarchical Clustering -

Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. It is widely used in data mining and machine learning to group similar objects into clusters based on their features. The resulting hierarchy is usually presented as a dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram showing how clusters are related

3. DBSCAN with PyCaret -

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering algorithm designed to identify clusters based on the density of data points. Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN does not require you to pre-specify the number of clusters and can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, even in the presence of noise.
