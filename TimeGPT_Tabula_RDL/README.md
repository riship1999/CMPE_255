TimeGPT and Tabular Models with Colabs

This repository provides a set of Colab notebooks demonstrating various time series and tabular prediction techniques using TimeGPT, Tabular, and RDL (Relational Deep Learning). Each Colab notebook covers a specific use case, with comprehensive explanations and results. The project is intended to serve as a practical resource for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, synthetic data generation, and GNN-based tabular prediction tasks.
